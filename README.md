# Predicting_Job_Roles-
# Overview

The Predicting Job Roles project aims to identify or predict the most suitable job role for an individual based on their skills, education, and experience.
By applying various machine learning algorithms, this model helps understand how candidate attributes map to career paths and can be used in recruitment analytics or career guidance systems.

# Objective

To build a machine learning model that predicts the job role of a candidate using relevant features from the dataset such as education level, specialization, years of experience, and technical skills.

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains various attributes that describe an individual's academic and professional background.
Typical features include:

# Education Qualification / Degree

# Specialization or Major

# Years of Experience

# Technical and Soft Skills

# Current Employment / Industry

# Target Variable: Job Role (the category to be predicted)

# Data Preprocessing Steps

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns.

Feature Encoding: Converting categorical data (like specialization) into numeric form using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.

Feature Scaling: Normalizing/standardizing numerical columns for uniform model performance.

Train-Test Split: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets (typically 80:20 ratio).

Machine Learning Models Used

Multiple models were trained and compared to evaluate accuracy and generalization performance:

S.No	Algorithm	Type	Description
1	Linear Regression	Regression	Predicts a continuous numeric output (e.g., salary, years of experience).
2	Logistic Regression	Classification	Predicts categorical outcomes like job roles.
3	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)	Classification	Classifies data points based on feature similarity.
4	Decision Tree	Classification	Builds a tree-like model for decision-making.
5	Support Vector Machine (SVM)	Classification	Finds the best hyperplane to separate classes.
6	Random Forest	Ensemble	Combines multiple decision trees for higher accuracy.
7	XGBoost	Boosting Ensemble	Advanced boosting algorithm providing top performance.
